Valuable services support many variations in clients, such as mobile versus web and different forms of web interface. It’s tempting to design a single back-end API to support all clients with a reusable API. But client needs vary, as do constraints such as bandwidth for mobile devices versus the desire for lots of data on fast web connections. Consequently it’s often best to **define different back-end services for each kind of front-end** client. These back ends should be developed by teams aligned with each front end to ensure that each back end properly meets the needs of its client.

> 有价值的服务支持客户机中的许多变体，例如移动与网络以及不同形式的网络接口。设计一个单一的后端API来支持所有具有可重用API的客户机是很诱人的。但是，客户机需求是不同的，移动设备的带宽等约束条件与快速网络连接上大量数据的需求也是不同的。因此，通常最好为每种前端客户端定义不同的后端服务。这些后端应该由与每个前端对齐的团队开发，以确保每个后端正确地满足其客户的需求。
